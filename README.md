## PyBank
Script that calculates the following from a CSV file:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

It then prints the results in a text file.

## PyPoll
Script that calculates the following from a CSV file:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

It then prints the results in a text file.

## Other Notes
The logic in this script is dependent on the candidate names. I know there is a way to make it "independent", and grab names/calculations, but I'm not quite there yet in my Python abilities.
